# OPTCounter_Andriod
The Andriod version of the OPTCounter I did, this was done same time but never uploaded.
It's just an Android app to give the user the date that his OPT card should be ready. The 90 days suggested time is used to calculate the date.

Pull the project, build it and use the Android exporter to push it to your android phone.
